            <h1>Why I Choose This Title</h1>
            <p>
                I chose this title because from the very beginning, Patricia was the reason Trevor was born. She chose
                to
                have him even when it was dangerous. She taught him how to think, how to survive, and how to stay
                strong.
                Later, when she was with Abel, she didn't stay silent—she fought for her freedom. Everything Trevor
                became
                started with her fight. That's why I believe he was not just born during apartheid—he was born of her
                fight.

                    Born a Crime by Trevor Noah is more than a story of growing up in apartheid South Africa; it’s a tribute to survival, hope, and family strength. 
                    As I explored the pages of his life, I realized that behind every laugh and every struggle, there’s a deeper fight — not just against racism,
                     but against the chains of limitation.

                    <p>The quote, “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage,” really
                        hit me—especially when
                        I read the part in Born a Crime where Abel beats Patricia. It broke my heart.What's worse is
                        that this isn't
                        just something from the past. Even today, many women still go through the same kind of pain,
                        silently. In my own life, I've seen it. I've talked with friends who seem strong on the outside, but deep
                        down, they don't believe in their own strength.
                    </p>
                    <button  id="nextPageOne"><span class="greater">Continue ...&gt;</span></button>

                <div class="response" id="responseTwo">
                    <button id="previouspageTwo"> <span class="less">&lt;</span></button>
                    <p> When they're hurt or controlled by someone they love, they stay quiet. They say things like,
                        “Maybe he'll change” or “I don't want to ruin the relationship.”
                        It's like they're stuck between being strong and being what society expects from a “good” woman.
                        This quote makes me think about how gender roles still affect relationships today.
                        Some men say they love confident, independent women—but when they're actually with one, they
                        feel the need to control her. It's unfair and painful to see.
                        A relationship should never be about power or fear.
                    </p>
                    <button id="nextPageTwo"><span class="greater">Continue ...&gt;</span></button>

                    <button id="previouspageThree"><span class="less">&lt;</span></button>
                    <p>When I read about Patricia, I saw someone who refused to be caged. That gives me strength.
                        It also makes me feel angry—angry at how many women still suffer in silence. But that anger
                        pushes me.
                        It motivates me to work harder, to use my voice, and to support the women around me—my friends,
                        my sisters, and even strangers—so that no one feels alone in their fight.
                        <p class="special-quote"><q>We deserve to be free. Not just free to speak—but free to live, love, and be
                            respected without fear.</q></p>

            <p>While I deeply admire Patricia’s courage and her unbreakable love for her son, one question still lingers in my mind: why do so many women stay with men who hurt them? Even when Trevor begged his mother to leave, she remained — holding on, hoping, surviving. Eventually, she found her way out and reclaimed her life, but I couldn’t help feeling a sense of disappointment and sadness. It’s a pattern I continue to see around me today — strong women, chained not by weakness, but by hope, fear, or love. It made me realize that leaving is not always a simple choice, even when staying costs so much. Their battles are silent, but their strength is undeniable.</p>
